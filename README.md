# dun-gen
### A small sample exploring Dependency Injection via Constructor Injection, written in Swift.

Generates a random dungeon layout using either breadth-first or depth-first graph traversal.

Use the keyboard to trigger new layouts:
- b: Breadth-first layout, tends to be "blob-like"
- d: Depth-first layout, tends to be "snake-like"
- r: Random between Breadth-first and Depth-first

#### Example Output
